This course is an internship at a work place of our choosing. I decided to do my LIA at [Bluescreen AB](https://www.bluescreen.se/) which is a company that work with IT solutions and Web development. 
My third assignment was to produce a customized monthly report from Google Analytics. It will later be implemented in their administrator system.

First you choose which company and month you want the report for.
Then you choose which data you want to display, by checking/unchecking checkboxes and for adWords you fill out input fields. Calls are made to Analytics API and the result displayed in tables and charts.
